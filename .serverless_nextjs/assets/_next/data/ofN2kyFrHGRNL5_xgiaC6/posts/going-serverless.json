What started as just a quick NextJS blog project turned into exploring more AWS. Utilized the Serverless Component CLI to deploy this at edge on lambda and Cloudfront. Really happy with the results now I just need to automate the deployments on github actions and I will have a fully featured stack. Anyway short post, going to actually relax a bit this weekend now. Stay tuned for more and remember source code is available on github.</p>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/hello-world/cover.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/hello-world/cover.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
